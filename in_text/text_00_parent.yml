  This data release provides all data, code, and modelling results used in Topp et al. (2021b) to examine the
  influence of deep learning architecture on generalizability when predicting stream temperature 
  in the Delaware River Basin (DRB). Briefly, we modeled stream temperature in the DRB using
  two spatially and temporally aware process guided deep learning models (a recurrent graph convolution network - RGCN, 
  and a temporal convolution graph model - Graph WaveNet). The associated 
  manuscript explores how the architectural differences between the two models influence how
  they learn spatial and temporal relationships, and how those learned relationships influence a models ability
  to accurately predict stream temperature as domains shift towards out-of-bounds conditions.
